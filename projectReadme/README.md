## Installation
Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

### Technologies Utilized


## Usage
The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

### Description
A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

## License

## Contributing
Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work.

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
